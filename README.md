# MultiCompartmentMicrobiome
Multicompartment Study of Host-Microbiome Interactions in Critical Illness

# This repository provides the code and primary de-identified data for regeneration of all results reported in the pre-print https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37808745/ which is under peer review as of 3.25.24

# The code is provided as an R Markdown document with all the necessary libraries
# Deidentified data are provided as csv or xlsx files. 
# We recommend running the code in chuncks and in the order provided - some of the analyses take long running time (e.g. clustering or joint modeling bootstrapped confidence interval estimations), which may lead to unintended interruptions of R sessions depending on available memory/capacity.
